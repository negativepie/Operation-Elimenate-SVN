Goal: Design text based RPG game with a turn based battle system. Players and enemies can be subclasses of a gameobject class, with fully functional stats and details such as names (covers string requirement), various moves amongst different types of enemies and different behaviours such as sounds (covers object requirement and in turn enforces the use of abstract classes when a general 'gameobject' class is used. This then simpliefies things through inheritance. This in turn allows enemies and players to be used in say a gameobject array of some sort (covers array requirement as well as polymorphism), allowing for multiple enemies and easy manipulation of a battle. User input and output can be easily obtained by choosing moves.
