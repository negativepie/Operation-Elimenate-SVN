# Operation-Eliminate-SVN
Things to do:

- Start

-----------------------------

Project Plan:

OOP Game

Make a game with a turn based battle system (pokemon style, maybe FF7 style if we have time) We could use a frame counter if we do FF7 system. 

Array keeping track of all the enemies (Polymorphism as we have different kinds of enemies)

Enemy objects instantiated (with health,dmg), use inheritance for different kinds of enemies (SVN Marking system as Boss 1HKO player)

Abstract Classes-Have enemies class with no default method, it is dealt with later whenever we want, monsters have different attacks and "sounds"

Testing
-test enemies + player are taking damage
-things are dying properly
