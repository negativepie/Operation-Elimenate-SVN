# Operation-Eliminate-SVN

Place '.' in '()' when a task is complete like so (.)

# Code is mostly functional, yay!?

# Coding

- Speed () 
- Name input ()
- Make text nice and neat ()
- Weather (.) (Functional, needs text added for all cases)
- Stats (Defese, Magic Defense) (.)
- Attacks which yield different damage dependent on stats (.)
- Enemy Inheritance ()
- Text ()
- SVN Final Boss () (Basics there)
- Leveling system ()
- Different abilities? (.) (Reimu) (just need to make them more diverse)
- Menu ()

- Change conditional statements into switch statements if possible ()

# Testing

- Basic getting and setting functions ()
- Enemy death (.)
- Switching to next enemy ()
- Player death (.)
- Correct damage ()
- Turn changing ()
- Speed priority ()
- RNG testing () (random weather/attacks)
- Extreme cases (large or zero integers where unexpected, )

- Regression testing ()

# Other

- Also need to make sure specification of the program is present and done at the practical session

# Longer term ideal goals (not necessary to complete all)

- Leveling system ()
- Speed ()
- The game not just being a battle () (menu etc., basic outside game things)
- Enemy sounds ()
- Moves which extend over multiple turns ()
- Arbitrary amount of enemies () (i.e. add enemy function, could also extend to mutliple players or multiple enemies in one battle: mainly requires speed to be at all interesting)
